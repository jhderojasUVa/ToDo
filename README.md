# What is ToDo

ToDo is a place to put a simple ToDo application (you know, an app where you put things to do) in different languages or frameworks in an eye of a front end.

The reason it's to help people know the different basic ways how to create a web app.

## Angular. Done v0.1

Of course there will be an Angular version of the simple ToDo. This will be made with Angular (not AngularJS).

## Angular JS. Done v0.1

The AngularJS version of the ToDo app. Simple and clean.

## Angular 7. (in progress)

This will be the Angular 7 version that uses the node server suplied here!.

## Angular 7 + Redux. (in progress)

This version will be using Angular 7 and Redux storage.

## React. Done v0.1 (need documentation)

A version made in React (with NO Redux) it's easy but nice to have.

## React + Redux. Not done

A version with React and Redux as storage.

## Polymer. Not done

A version made with Polymer.

## Node

If you need a server, on the todo_node_server you will find one to test for simple REST.

To run it: node server.js

And read the console :)
