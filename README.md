# What is ToDo

ToDo is a place to put a simple ToDo application (you know, an app where you put things to do) in different languages.

The reason it's to help people know the different basic ways how to create a web app.

## Angular. Not begin

Of course there will be an Angular version of the simple ToDo. This will be made with Angular (not AngularJS).

## Angular JS. Done v0.1

The AngularJS version of the ToDo app. Simple and clean.

## React. Not begin

A version made in React (with NO Redux) it's easy but nice to have.
